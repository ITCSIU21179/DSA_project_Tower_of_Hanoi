## Introduction
<div style = "text-align: justify">
This is our Tower of Hanoi game project for the Data Structure and Algorithms course at HCMIU in semester 1 (2023-2024). We all knew that the game was a classic, but we wanted to make it more interesting and challenging. So we decided to add some new features to the game. We hope you enjoy it the most comfortable!

### About The Game
The 2D Tower of Hanoi is a modern adaptation of the well-known
mathematical puzzle, the Tower of Hanoi. In this game, players encounter a twodimensional environment where they must transfer a tower of rings from one pole to the last pole, following the classic rules of the Tower of Hanoi. The challenge lies in moving the rings in ascending order of size, without placing a larger ring on top of a smaller one.
As players progress through levels, the difficulty increases, introducing more complex arrangements of rings. The game's intuitive controls allow for seamless interaction, promoting an enjoyable and accessible gaming experience. The vibrant and visually appealing design enhances engagement, making the 2D Tower of Hanoi an entertaining and educational choice for those seeking a mix of strategy and logic in a classic puzzle format. Whether played casually or as a brain-teasing exercise, this game offers a delightful way to explore the timeless principles of the Tower of Hanoi in a contemporary gaming setting.
### Goals
- Create a game redesign that is entertaining and logical for the players.
- Implement algorithms and structures learned in the theory class.
- Go through the process of game management and code refactoring.
- Evaluate the ability to build more features on top of the basic code and apply design patterns.
