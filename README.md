## Introduction
<div style = "text-align: justify">
This is our Tower of Hanoi game project for the Data Structure and Algorithms course at HCMIU in semester 1 (2023-2024). We all knew that the game is a classic, but we wanted to make it more interesting and challenging. So we decided to add some new features to the game. We hope you enjoy it the most comfortable  !
